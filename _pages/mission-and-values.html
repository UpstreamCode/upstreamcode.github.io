        <p>
          Upstream is the vehicle by which a community of technologists,
          designers, and church planters innovate together.

      <div class="q-card">
        <p class="question">What We Do</p>
        <p>
          We partner with missional technologists and field teams to
          meaningfully impact church planting efforts to the unreached.

      <div class="q-card">
        <p class="question">How We Do It</p>
        <p>
          Through volunteers and intern cohorts, we build apps that distribute
          digital Scripture, story, and song to unreached language groups.

          <h3>Theological and Missiological Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            In contrast to some recent trends in modern missions, we do not view
            speed or reproducibility as the highest aims in church planting
            efforts. Our ecclesiology and ministry philosophy serve as the
            foundation for how we approach evangelism and discipleship.
