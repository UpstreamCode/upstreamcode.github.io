        <p>
          Upstream is the vehicle by which a community of technologists,
          designers, and church planters innovate together.

        <p class="question">What We Do</p>
        <p>
          We partner with missional technologists and field teams to
          meaningfully impact church planting efforts to the unreached.

        <p>
          Through volunteers and intern cohorts, we build apps that distribute
          digital Scripture, story, and song to unreached language groups.

          <p>
            In contrast to some recent trends in modern missions, we do not view
            speed or reproducibility as the highest aims in church planting
            efforts. Our ecclesiology and ministry philosophy serve as the
            foundation for how we approach evangelism and discipleship.

        <h1>Abandon Her Passion or Say “No” to Missions</h1>
        <p>
          While getting her engineering degree, Jaya felt God pulling her heart
          towards mission work. However, there was no clear path for integrating
          software engineering with church planting efforts in the context of
          frontier missions.
