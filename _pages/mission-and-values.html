        <p class="question">What We Do</p>
        <p>
          We partner with missional technologists and field teams to
          meaningfully impact church planting efforts to the unreached.

        <p class="question">How We Do It</p>
        <p>
          Through volunteers and intern cohorts, we build apps that distribute
          digital Scripture, story, and song to unreached language groups.
