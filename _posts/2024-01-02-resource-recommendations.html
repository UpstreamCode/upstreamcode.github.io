<h2>Learn With Us</h2>

<p>
  There is an ocean of resources about missions, technology, faith and work,
  theology…the list of topics goes on and on. If you’re like us, life is busy
  and you can’t read everything. We’ve curated a shortlist that we hope
  illuminates a trusted pathway through the sea of options. Or at least it can
  serve as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
  These resources have also formed and shaped Upstream. We’ve allowed these
  books to influence how we think and approach ministry. In this sense, the list
  also gives a bit of a behind the scenes look into who we are and what we
  value.
