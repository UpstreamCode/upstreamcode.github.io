## Development

Set up developer environment: https://desiredpersona.com/install-jekyll-on-macos/.

### Code Quality

To verify your code meets certain code standards, and to protect from accidentally creating common mistakes, we provide linters to verify your code. First you will need to install the linters using NodeJS and npm. Run the following command from the terminal in the project's root directory:

```
npm install
```

Now you can test your code quality by running this command:

```
npm run lint
```

Happy coding!
