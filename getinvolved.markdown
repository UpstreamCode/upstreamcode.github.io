## I’m a developer. How can I join?

### From home
If you're an industry professional, it would be a privilege to touch base with you about our projects and explore how the Lord might be overlapping your story with ours.  Send us an email at [upstream.code@gmail.com](mailto:upstream.code@gmail.com).

### Short-term
Edge and Venture are our short and mid-term opportunities up to one year long. They are support raised through Pioneers, and we are able to work with universities to fulfill internship requirements. We’d love for you to join us! Check out [Pioneers.org](https://edge.pioneers.org/#/) for more details.   <br />

### Long-term
Whether you’re looking to move overseas or are already on the field, we want to connect with you. If Upstream isn’t a good fit, we may have connections with other teams and projects that might be. We’d love to be a resource for you.

<br />

## Get in Touch

We are based on an open source model and invite anyone who’s interested to send us an email at [upstream.code@gmail.com](mailto:upstream.code@gmail.com). We’ll connect with you and explore how we can partner together.

We are a network of [Pioneers](https://pioneers.org/#/) and our natural connections tend to gravitate there. Although some of our opportunities to get connected are related to Pioneers, we have no expectations for you to become a member of the organization. Upstream’s heart is to stand at the intersection of development and the unreached, regardless of church background and organizational ties.

To all of the above, we are so thankful for your interest in Upstream. We praise God for moving in your heart to see the nations have access to the King of Kings and pray that he leads you more and more towards who He’s created you to be. Whether that’s with or without Upstream, we are thrilled to run this race with you.
